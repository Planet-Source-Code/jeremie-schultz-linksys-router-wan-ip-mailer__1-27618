## Linksys Router WAN IP Mailer


</div>

### Description

This code is for people who use a linksys router for internet access via a cable or dsl modem. It will email the WAN ip when it changes, to email addresses in a database. It has modified code from the automailer v1.0 on this site. It has been requested of me from other people who use the linksys routers. It could be adapted to grab any info from a webpage and email the recipients when that info has changed.
 
### More Info
 
I have included a compiled exe, but changed the extension to ex_. Please rename it if you want to run it. Or recompile the source.

Not much error checking at this point. Time delay can not be greater than 60 seconds.
